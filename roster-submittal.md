## Roster Update Process

### When to Update

Submit roster updates when:

- New swimmers join your team
- Swimmers leave your team
- Contact information changes
- Officials certifications change

### How to Update

1. Export fresh CSV from SwimTopia (for roster data changes)
2. Upload to the Roster Formatter tool
3. Your contacts and officials will load automatically from local storage
4. Update any changes to contacts or officials
5. Export and republish to the league site

> **Tip:** For minor contact updates only, you can skip the CSV upload and just export the updated contacts HTML.

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing required columns" Error

**Cause:** The CSV doesn't have the required columns.

**Solution:** Re-export from SwimTopia using **Reports > Athlete Roster**. Other report types may not include all required fields.

### Swimmers Appear in Wrong Age Group

**Cause:** SwimTopia age group assignments may not match GPSA age groups.

**Solution:**

- Verify swimmer birthdates in SwimTopia
- Check the age-up date setting for your team
- The tool strips gender prefixes automatically (e.g., "Boys 9-10" becomes "9-10")

### Contacts/Officials Didn't Save

**Cause:** Browser localStorage was cleared, or you're using a different browser/device.

**Solution:**

- Re-enter the information (it will auto-save)
- Use the same browser and device consistently
- Consider keeping a backup document with contact information

### Email Shows Red Border

**Cause:** The email format is invalid.

**Solution:**

- Verify the email includes `@` and a domain (e.g., `name@example.com`)
- Check for extra spaces or typos
- The border turns green when the format is valid

### Export Button Doesn't Work

**Cause:** Browser clipboard permissions or compatibility issue.

**Solution:**

- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Allow clipboard permissions if prompted
- Refresh the page and try again
- The modal shows a "Copy Code" button as backup
